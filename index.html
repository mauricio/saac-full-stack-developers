					<h1 style="color: white;">Life was much easier...</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Was it, really?</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Ok, some knowledge was transferable</h1>
					<p>
						SQL, database modelling, Linux management.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>But from PHP to Ruby...</h1>
					<p>
						... there isn't much you can transfer.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What did really change?</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>JavaScript is not (only) jQuery anymore</h1>
					<p>Wait, the name wasn't jQuery??????</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Relational databases are not the (only) default</h1>
					<p>But documentation and standarization for the new databases suck,
					so we understand your complaints a bit.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>You can't just FTP your website anymore</h1>
					<p>You don't really miss this, do you? Please say you don't.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>You didn't really know everything back then</h1>
					<p>And you still don't have to know it all now.</p>

				<section>
					<h1>Putting recruiting aside</h1>
					<p>What does it usualy mean to be a full stack developer now?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Generalist + Specialist</h1>
					<p>Full stack developers are both specialists and generalists</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Really love building your #golang backend?</h1>
					<p>Awesome, but be ready to jump into the React front end as well!</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Why?</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Because it provides perspective</h1>
					<p>
						How do I know if the awesome API I've built is really awesome? Using it.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>And causes pain</h1>
					<p>
						How do I know if my app is scalable? Signing up for the on-call schedule.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>What are the pieces involved here?</h1>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Backend systems</li>
							<li>Frontend systems</li>
							<li>Mobile systems</li>
							<li>Infrastructure provisioning and troubleshooting</li>
							<li>Optimization and scaling</li>
							<li>UX design</li>
						</ul>

					<p style="color: white; background-color: black;">Learn all this?</p>
				</section>

				<section
					data-background="images/relief.gif"
				>
					<p style="color: white; background-color: black;">Nope. But at least try.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Being great at everything is hard</h1>
					<p>
						It's not that you shouldn't try, you just don't have to beat yourself and
						burnout while trying.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Backend systems</h1>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Programming languages and/or platforms (JVM, CLR, OTP)</li>

							<li>One or more frontend frameworks</li>
							<li>Frontend optimization</li>
							<li>User experience design</li>

					<h1>Deliberate practice is your friend</h1>
					<p>
						Forget about the 10k hours, 10k hours of lifting the same weight will never make you strong. If it doesn't hurt it's not worth it.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Switch</h1>
					<p>
						Teams, technology stacks, application, position, company, anything you can. 10 years of experience inside the same Rails app isn't really 10 years of experience, sorry.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>The more you learn, the more you transfer</h1>
					<p>
						Know Scala? Getting into OCaml, Haskell or Rust is now easier.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Don't panic!</h1>
					<p>
						It takes time, you're not going to get experience with all this
						in a week.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section
					data-background="images/the-bridge.jpg"
				>
					<h1 style="color: white; background-color: black;">Be the bridge</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Connecting teams and building empathy</h1>
					<p>
						Being the glue that holds teams together is also the job of the
						full stack developer.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Layers and layers</h1>
					<p>
						Working through the different layers of the apps being built provides
						a better idea of what is being done and how the teams are accomplishing
						their goals.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>It's just progress</h1>
					<p>
						If your job is to build applications, going full stack is the natural path
						for your career, no need to be afraid about it.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>How did it happen for me?</h1>
					<p>
						Joined Neat.com 3 years ago, backend developer.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>We needed more OPS</h1>
					<p>
						It wasn't much of a choice, really, either we joined the OPS team or our apps
						would take a long time to see the light of day.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>No Chef experience</h1>
					<p>
						But it's Ruby, how hard could that be, right? ðŸ’€
					</p>
				</section>

				<section
					data-background="images/crying.gif"
				>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>OPS team provided guidance and feedback</h1>
					<p>
						Having people directing you towards the goal is a huge win
						when switching paths (huge kudos to Travis Truman and Richard Henning)
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Next!</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>App rewrite, moving from ASP.NET to Rails</h1>
					<p>
						App needed a fast and responsive UI, perfect for a single page app. Jumped into
						the backend and the ReactJS frontend to get the job done (Leo Rodrigues
						was the guide here).
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Am I a full stack developer?</h1>
				</section>

				<section
					data-background="images/no-idea.gif"
				>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>But that doesn't prevent me from doing it</h1>
					<p>
						Continuous learning should be your main takeaway here, it is the only
						way to make progress and evolve as a developer, no matter what your
						favorite tech is.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Questions?</h1>
